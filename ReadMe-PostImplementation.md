# Memory Game

#### This project is made on considering the following assumptions:

- No framework(e.g. React) is used in the development.
- There is scoring mechanism that adds 10 points on every correct answer.
- The timer is not used in any of the score calculation, but an indicator to suggest how much time it took to finish the game.
- Only single/local multiple player can play this game, maximum 4 players at a time.
- Only one test case is present using Jest.
- The UI/css is basic, using Javascript,HTML along with what was included in the starter kit like WebPack, Babel, Sass.
- It uses the inbuilt url(Express running on port 3002) that came with the starter kit for fetching the images.

#### Future scope that can be considered to make this application better:

- Networked multiple player, where players can play against each other using the link.
- Saving user records as history and showcasing user's best score.
- Implementing levels which progresses as the difficulty increases, with increasing rows and columns as the level increases.
- Better animation can be implemented like flip of cards, fancy winner alert, etc.
- Can also use timer to calculate scores based on time.
- Accessibility can be better, need more testing.
- Can create .ts files to using typescript more to enhance type-safety when the project grows.
- Can also create workflow file to automate the process when running in CI/CD.
- Should have more test cases.
